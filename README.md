# Crypto tax calculator
A tool to help calculate crypto activites for the declaraci√≥n de la renta.

Currently only works with csv files provided by Binance.

*** Still very much a work in progress ***  
Use at your own risk, I am not an accountant

## How to use
Get your csv files for income gains and capital gains from Binance tax. Copy these files to the program directory and run the calculator with `python main.py`
