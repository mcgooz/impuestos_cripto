# Crypto tax calculator
A tool to help calculate what to add in casilla 0027 (income gains) and the section "Ganancias y pérdidas patrimoniales derivadas de la transmisión o permuta de monedas virtuales por particulares"

Currently only works with csv files provided by Binance.

*** Still very much a work in progress ***

## How to use
Get your csv files for income gains and capital gains from Binance tax. Copy these files to the program directory and run the calculator.
